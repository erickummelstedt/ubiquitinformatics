Features; 
1. Build, test and connect the following aspects
    DONE a. iterating through ubiquitin
        i. really robustly fix the errors in affirm_branching sites/sequences -- make the string adaptable (str contains)

    - Build simulation and datatables of simulation with tests - finalize everything
    - Build in 3D simulation

    - connect user interface to ubiquitin ecosystem, build out fastAPI system
    - user interface for opening up ubiquitin - use fastAPI template

    b. simulation of ubiquitin synthesis 
    
    c. building reaction maps and inventory checks -- by end of april
    d. build 2D representation of ubiquitin
    e. build 3D representation of ubiquitin
    f. featurise gui to sift through reaction schemes in 2D and 3D
