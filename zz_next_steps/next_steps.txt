Features; 
1. Build, test and connect the following aspects
    DONE a. iterating through ubiquitin
    DONE b. simulation of ubiquitin synthesis 
    DONE c. generate database

    DONE - figure out K48 elongation/branching 
    
    - run simulation for tetramers and pentamers (each individually saved)
    - recreate the reaction schemes for tetramers and pentamers

    - build the tests for 2D and 3D representation of ubiquitin
    - finalize the simulation - only up to pentamer
    - connect user interface to ubiquitin ecosystem, build out fastAPI system
    - user interface for opening up ubiquitin - use fastAPI template
    - build the histag with a DHHHHHH at the moment its only HHHHHH


    - build reaction maps and inventory checks 
    - connect to automated python

    - Build in 3D simulation - finalize json_to_mol2.py with tests and everything.
        a. just 3Dmol.js
        b. build the histag with a DHHHHHH at the moment its only HHHHHH
    
    c. building reaction maps and inventory checks -- by end of april
    d. build 2D representation of ubiquitin
    e. build 3D representation of ubiquitin
    f. featurise gui to sift through reaction schemes in 2D and 3D
