Features; 
1. Build, test and connect the following aspects
    DONE a. iterating through ubiquitin
    DONE b. simulation of ubiquitin synthesis 
    DONE c. generate database
    DONE d. figure out K48 elongation/branching 
    DONE e. build the histag with a DHHHHHH at the moment its only HHHHHH in the JSON
    DONE f. run simulation for tetramers and pentamers (each individually saved) 

    - DONE - Filtering system for max_abocs; semi completed; build tests
    - DONE - Get table of unprotected multimers; need to complete
    - Connect the two (add multimer and final route chosen)

    - Create UI aspect that pulls out the numbered choices
    - Connect the calculations

    - Highlight the reaction schemes that were used in the end for each multimer - manually label them for pentamers

    - Show cleanly on the website
    - 2D representation below the skimming bar 

    - Take up to 16 spots, but use 14 only each time for now
    - Highlight the routes that were chosen
    - Change loacation of test data (DATA file) file 
    - Park the stuff regarding mathematically choosing routes
    - recreate the reaction schemes for tetramers and pentamers
    - build the tests for 2D and 3D representation of ubiquitin
    - connect user interface to ubiquitin ecosystem, build out fastAPI system
    - user interface for opening up ubiquitin - use fastAPI template
    - build the histag with a DHHHHHH at the moment its only HHHHHH in 3D simualation

    - build reaction maps and inventory checks 
    - connect to automated python

    - Build in 3D simulation - finalize json_to_mol2.py with tests and everything.
        a. just 3Dmol.js
        b. build the histag with a DHHHHHH at the moment its only HHHHHH
    
    c. building reaction maps and inventory checks -- by end of april
    d. build 2D representation of ubiquitin
    e. build 3D representation of ubiquitin
    f. featurise gui to sift through reaction schemes in 2D and 3D
